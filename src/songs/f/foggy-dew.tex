\beginsong{Foggy Dew}[by={Traditionell}, index={Twas down the glen one easter morn}]
% key Am

\beginverse
'Twas \[Am]down the glen one \[G]Easter \[Em]morn \brk to a \[Am]city f\[Dm]air rode \[Am]I,
There \[Am]armed lines of \[G]marching \[Em]men \brk in \[Am]squadrons \[Dm]passed me \[Am]by;
No \[C]pipe did hum, no \[G]battle \[C]drum did \brk \[Am]sound its \[Em]loud tat\[F]too,
But the \[Am]Angelus bell o'er the \[G]Liffey's \[Em]swell \brk rang \[Am]out through the \[Dm]Foggy \[Am]Dew.
\endverse

\beginverse
Right \[Am]proudly high o'er \[G]Dublin \[Em]Town \brk they \[Am]hung out the \[Dm]flag of \[Am]war,
'Twas \[Am]better to die neath an \[G]Irish \[Em]sky \brk than at \[Am]Suvla or \[Dm]Sud El \[Am]Bar;
And \[C]from the plains of \[G]Royal \[C]Meath \brk strong \[Am]men came \[Em]hurrying \[F]through,
While Brit\[Am]tania's sons, with their \[G]long range \[Em]guns, \brk sailed \[Am]in through the \[Dm]Foggy \[Am]Dew.
\endverse

\beginverse
O, the \[Am]night fell black, and the \[G]rifles \[Em]crack \brk made \[Am]Perfidious \[Dm]Albion \[Am]reel,
'Mid the \[Am]leaden rain, seven \[G]tongues of \[Em]flame \brk did \[Am]shine o'er the \[Dm]lines of s\[Am]teel;
By each \[C]shinning blade a \[G]prayer was \[C]said \brk that to \[Am]Ireland her \[E]sons be \[F]true,
And when \[Am]morning broke still the \[G]war flag \[Em]shook \brk out it's \[Am]folds in the \[Dm]Foggy \[Am]Dew.
\endverse

\beginverse
'Twas \[Am]England bade our \[G]Wild Geese \[Em]go \brk that small \[Am]nations \[Dm]might be \[Am]free,
But their \[Am]lonely graves are by \[G]Sulva's \[Em]waves \brk or the \[Am]shores of the \[Dm]Great North \[Am]Sea.
Oh \[C]had they died by \[G]Pearse's \[C]side \brk or had \[Am]fought with \[Em]Cathal \[F]Brugha,
Their \[Am]names we'd keep where the \[G]Fenians \[Em]sleep, \brk 'neath the \[Am]shroud of the \[Dm]Foggy \[Am]Dew
\endverse

\beginverse
But the \[Am]bravest fell, and the \[G]requiem \[Em]bell \brk rang \[Am]mournfully \[Dm]and \[Am]clear,
For \[Am]those who died that \[G]Easter\[Em]tide \brk in the \[Am]springtime \[Dm]of the \[Am]year.
While the \[C]world did gaze with \[G]deep a\[C]maze \brk at those \[Am]fearless \[Em]men but \[F]few,
Who \[Am]bore the fight that \[G]freedom's \[Em]light \brk might \[Am]shine through the \[Dm]Foggy \[Am]Dew,
\endverse

\beginverse
Back \[Am]through the glen I \[G]rode \[Em]again, \brk and my \[Am]heart with \[Dm]grief was \[Am]sore,
For \[Am]I parted then wit\[G]h valien\[Em]t men \brk who I \[Am]never shall \[Dm]see no\[Am]more;
But \[C]to and fro in my \[G]dreams I \[C]go, \brk and I'd \[Am]kneel and \[Em]pray for \[F]you,
For \[Am]slavery fled, o' \[G]glorious \[Em]dead \brk when you \[Am]fell in the \[Dm]Foggy \[Am]Dew.
\endverse
